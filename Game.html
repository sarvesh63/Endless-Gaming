    <h2>My idea on games is like in future it should be very interesting and it's graphic matter's the most and the creativity we can 
    use coding also for the lobby in which we can change the character and dress.Also it should be creative like minecraft and fortnite
    and because I am talking about future everybody will have a virtual reality game so if fps games are in virtual reality it would can be the best game in the world.The idea of AI has been expressed in gaming for decades — most prominently in non-player characters (NPCs), like the colorful ghosts in Pac-Man or the innocent bystanders in Grand Theft Auto.

Characters like these are typically programmed with what designers call a “finite state machine.” In the plainest possible terms, this means that NPCs follow a script, or an if-then statement. “If the game is on, then chase Pac-Man,” the ghosts’ script might say. “And if Pac-Man eats a Power Pellet, then run away from him”.In the future, could we expect to see more advanced AI appear in commercial games? It’s possible, according to experts; but not all are convinced it's coming anytime soon.Because it would be like we are actually hitting somebody and also one more idea in coding is that we can creat a lobby of a fps game like in that we can change character and his dress but it would not be easy and many games are created ny coding like the background and the lobby and many things can be done by coding.
